In 2010, the National Institutes of Health (NIH) contracted with the Institute of Medicine (IOM)
to undertake a study and make recommendations “to increase the recognition of pain as a significant
public health problem in the United States.” The resulting 2011 IOM report called for a cultural
transformation in pain prevention, care, education, and research and recommended development of
“a comprehensive population health-level strategy” to address these issues.1 In response to the report,
the Assistant Secretary for Health, Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) asked the Interagency
Pain Research Coordinating Committee (IPRCC) to oversee creation of this National Pain Strategy (NPS).
Experts from a broad array of public and private organizations explored areas identified in the core IOM
recommendations—population research, prevention and care, disparities, service delivery and reimbursement,
professional education and training, and public awareness and communication. A companion effort is
underway to address the IOM’s call for further research to support the cultural transformation.
